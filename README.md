# Connectorless-zigzag-1x6-mini-ISP-connector
An Arduino ISP connector is used, among others, for burning a bootloader and for programming ATtiny chips. When the ISP connector is only used once, it would be more convenient not to use a connector. Therefore, I created the connectorless 1x6 mini ISP connector and the mini 1x6 ISP adapter. By the zigzag positions of the PCB holes, the male ISP connector pins press against the holes and make electrical contact and so, no PCB connector is needed.
